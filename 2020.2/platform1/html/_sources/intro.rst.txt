Introduction
============

The Versal VMK180 TRD consists of a series of platforms, accelerators and Jupyter
notebooks to demonstrate various aspects of the design. A platform is a Vivado
design with a pre-instantiated set of I/O interfaces and a corresponding
PetaLinux BSP and image that includes the required kernel drivers and user-space
libraries to exercise those interfaces. Accelerators are mapped to FPGA logic
resources  and stitched into the platform using the Vitis
toolchain. The reference design currently supports the VMK180 evaluation board.

Platform
---------

The following is a list of supported platforms including key I/O interfaces:


  * Sources:

    * USB webcam capture pipeline

    * File source

    * MIPI CSI-2 image sensor capture pipeline via FMC daughter card

  * Processing:

    * VP9 decode and demux

    * 2D Filter (PL)


  * Sinks:

    * HDMI Tx + video mixer display pipeline

    * Application sink into jupyter notebook display

Software Stack
--------------

The main software frameworks used in this reference design are:

* Jupyter notebooks for top-level application control and visualization

* GStreamer multimedia framework and plugins for video pipeline creation

* V4L2 kernel subsystem and drivers for video capture devices

* Xilinx run-time (XRT) and Xilinx OpenCL for acceleration kernels

* DRM/KMS kernel subsystem and drivers for display devices
