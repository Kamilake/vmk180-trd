Introduction
============

The Versal VMK180 TRD consists of a series of platforms, accelerators and Jupyter
notebooks to demonstrate various aspects of the design. A platform is a Vivado
design with a pre-instantiated set of I/O interfaces and a corresponding
PetaLinux BSP and image that includes the required kernel drivers and user-space
libraries to exercise those interfaces. Accelerators are mapped to FPGA logic
resources  and stitched into the platform using the Vitis
toolchain. The reference design currently supports the VMK180 evaluation board.
