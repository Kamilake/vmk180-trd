| Platform Name  | Description  |  Links |
| -------------- | ------------- |----------------|
| Platform 1: Multimedia TRD  |The multimedia TRD demonstrates video capture either from a file source, USB webcam or MIPI image sensor and displays it on a Jupyter Notebook or a HDMI monitor. Accelerator functions can also be added to this platform using Vitis. Supported acceleration function in this design is a 2D Filter.  |     Documentation   User Guide   Package
| Platform 2: PCIe TRD  |  The PCIe TRD demonstrates  video frames being transferred from a x86 host machine (root complex) to the VMK180 evaluation board (endpoint) through the PCIe QDMA bridge interface for data processing.  A 2D filter has been used to demonstrate image processing on the end point and finally transfers it back to host where it is displayed on monitor.  |  Documentation   User Guide   Package
| Platform 3: Ethernet TRD   | The Ethernet TRD demonstrates MRMAC capability on VMK180 Board.  Ethernet packets are  transferred between the board and the external NIC via GTY  using multi-rate media access control (MRMAC) IP .   | Documentation   User Guide   Package
