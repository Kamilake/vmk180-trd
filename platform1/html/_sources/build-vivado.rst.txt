Build the Vivado Design
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

* Reference Design zip file

* Vivado Design Suite 2020.2

Build Flow Tutorial
-------------------

.. tip::

   You can skip this tutorial and move straight to the next tutorial if desired.
   A pre-built XSA file is provided at
   *$working_dir/vmk180_trd_platform1_2020.2/platform/vmk180_trd_platform1/hw/vmk180_trd_platform1.xsa*

**Download Reference Design Files:**

Skip the following steps if the design zip file has already been downloaded and
extracted to a working directory

#. Download the VMK180 Targeted Reference Design ZIP file

#. Unzip Contents

The directory structure is described in the Introduction Section

**Generate Device Image and XSA:**

#. Enable Versal device support

   To enable Versal device support, you need to create two tcl initialization
   scripts, one for Vivado and one for HLS. Add the following line to each of
   the tcl scripts:

   .. code-block:: bash

      enable_beta_device *

   The initialization tcl script for Vivado shall be placed at:

   * **Linux**: $HOME/.Xilinx/Vivado/Vivado_init.tcl

   * **Windows**: %APPDATA%/Roaming/Xilinx/Vivado/Vivado_init.tcl

   Similarly, the initialization tcl script for HLS shall be placed at:

   * **Linux**: $HOME/.Xilinx/HLS_init.tcl

   * **Windows**: %APPDATA%/Roaming/Xilinx/HLS_init.tcl

#. Open the Vivado GUI.

   On Linux, at the command prompt enter:

   .. code-block:: bash

     cd $working_dir/vmk180_trd_platform1_2020.2/vivado
     vivado -source scripts/main.tcl

   A Vivado cockpit as shown below will open with vmk180_trd_platform1
   project populated.

#. In the Flow Navigator pane on the left-hand side under IP Integrator, click
   on *Open Block Design*. An IP Integrator (IPI) block design
   (*vmk180_trd_platform.bd*) becomes visible that contains the
   Control, Interface and Processing System (CIPS) IP, NOC IP,
   AXI Performace Monitors (APM), MIPI CSI capture pipeline and HDMI Tx display
   pipeline.

#. To view the Platform interfaces that are enabled for Vitis compiler to stitch
   in accelerators, on the tool bar at the top click on  *Window >
   Platform Interfaces*. Platform interfaces are enabled under the following IPs

   * clk_wiz: Clocks used to drive clock inputs on the accelerator.
   * smartconnect_gp2: AXI Memory Mapped master ports to drive the accelerator
     control port.
   * smartconnect_accel: AXI Memory Mapped slave ports driven by the
     accelerator data port.

   .. tip::
      For more information on how to setup Platform Interfaces refer to Section
      - Configuring Platform Interface Properties in https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2019_2/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration.pdf

#. In the Flow Navigator pane on the left-hand side under Program and Debug,
   click on *Generate Device Image*. The device image (pdi) for the design will
   be generated and available at
   *$working_dir/vmk180_trd_platform1_2020.2/vivado/project/vmk180_trd_platform1.runs/impl_1/vmk180_trd_platform1_wrapper.pdi*.

#. After Device Image Generation completes successfully a window pops up. Click
   on *Cancel*

#. To create the XSA, on the Tcl Console type the following command.

   .. code-block:: bash

      write_hw_platform -force -include_bit -file ./project/vmk180_trd_platform1.sdk/vmk180_trd_platform1.xsa

   The file *vmk180_trd_platform1.xsa* will be available in *$working_dir/vmk180_trd_platform1_2020.2/vivado/project/vmk180_trd_platform1.sdk*.
   It will be used as an input when building the Vitis Platform.
